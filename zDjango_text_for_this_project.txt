- when we are using ImageField we should install Pillow module
- when we are using images in our project we should create a folder called media in the Main folder of the project (which contains the project and the apps) and go to settings.py and add these (after USE_TZ = True { احتياطاً :) } ):
	MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
	MEDIA_ROOT = 'media/' 
- also we should go to urls.py in our project and use '+' operator to extend urlpatterns list with this list: [static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)] 
	[IMPORTANT Note: we should first import these:
		from django.conf.urls.static import static
		from django_store import settings
]
- when we want to use external css and javascript we should do these steps:
	a- we should create a folder called static in the Main folder of the project (which contains the project and the apps) and put our css and javascript files inside static folder

	b- go to settings.py and add (after STATIC_URL  |{| احتياطاً :) |}| ):
		STATICFILES_DIRS = [BASE_DIR / 'static']
		STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles') 
	[Note: notice that the os is a built-in module to Python]

	c- go to target template and add these tags in the begining of the template:
		{% load static %}
		{% load in18 %}

	d- go to our <link> and <script></script> tags and put herf and src attribute like this: 
		<link href="{% static "<the path to this file where this path start after static folder>" %}" ...>
		<script src="{% static "<the path to this file where this path start after static folder>" %}" ...></script>
		// for example:
			<script defer src="{% static "js/528.fcdc06c1.js" %}"></script>
			<link href="{% static "css/app.css" %}" rel="stylesheet">
	[Note: notice we start the path after (NOT from) static folder which in the example above contains 'js' file and 'css' file]
